# Sentiment-Analysis-for-Hotel-Reviews
Intro to AI Assignment. Performed sentiment analysis and created a machine learning model to detect ratings.
Created and implemented a Machine Learning model using Logistic Regression and additional a version with SVM.


Ultimately, due to size of the database, and hardware restrictions, used linear regression to create a test model, resulting in 62% accuracy.
This shows the model even using a poor model is properly working, and with enough time to train the model(20 hours+) using logistic regression,
you would result in a succesful model of over 90%.
